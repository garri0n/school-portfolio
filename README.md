Welcome to my portoflio for the CS152 Course.

I am Garri Clyde Nakano, from the team KG Movers. This repository contains logos, coursera certificates, user manuals for the prototype and other files. This application is a transportation booking service that  provides safe and quick transportation for the customers' satisfaction. Not only will it provide a safe and quick service but, it will also allow the customers to use their own route in going through their designated stopping point.

This portfolio includes:

-User Manual

-Team Logo

-Coursera Certificate
